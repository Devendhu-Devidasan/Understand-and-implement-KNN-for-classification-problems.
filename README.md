- Best Accuracy: (Write your accuracy here, example: 0.97)
- Confusion Matrix used for evaluation.

Conclusion

In this task, I successfully implemented the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification using the Iris dataset.  

The model performed well after normalizing the features and selecting an optimal value of K. Through experimentation, I understood how the value of K affects model accuracy and how scaling improves performance.  

Overall, this task helped me understand instance-based learning, distance metrics, and practical model evaluation techniques. It strengthened my understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts.
